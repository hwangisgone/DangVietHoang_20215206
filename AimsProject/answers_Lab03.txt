3. PASSING PARAMETERS
● Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
- Answer: JAVA is always a PASS BY VALUE programming language.

To test whether a programming language is passing by value or passing by reference, we usually use the
swap method. This method aims to swap an object to another object.
● After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
- Because the the swap function only changes the references of the copied objects, not the original ones

● After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
- Even though the dvd changes its reference, the original jungleDVD has its title changed is because of both dvd of the method changeTitle and jungleDVD points to the same object, then .setTitle
